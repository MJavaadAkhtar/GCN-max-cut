   "source": "# Summary and Conclusions\n\n## Algorithm Performance Analysis\n\nBased on the experiments conducted in this notebook, we can draw several conclusions about multi-way max-cut heuristics:\n\n### 1. **Algorithm Effectiveness**\n- **Simulated Annealing** generally provides the best solution quality for multi-way max-cut problems\n- **Recursive Multi-Cut** offers a good balance between speed and quality for smaller graphs\n- **Breakout Local Search** is effective for 2-way cuts but needs recursive extension for multi-way problems\n\n### 2. **Scalability Observations**\n- Simulated Annealing scales well to larger graphs (500+ nodes) with appropriate parameter tuning\n- Recursive approaches become computationally expensive for graphs with >200 nodes\n- Terminal constraints are effectively maintained across all algorithms\n\n### 3. **Parameter Recommendations**\n- **Small graphs (≤100 nodes)**: High temperature SA with 5000+ steps\n- **Medium graphs (100-500 nodes)**: Moderate temperature SA with 10000+ steps  \n- **Large graphs (>500 nodes)**: Fast SA with fewer steps or specialized heuristics\n\n### 4. **Integration with Neural Networks**\n- Heuristic solutions provide excellent benchmarks for neural network training\n- The tensor conversion utilities enable direct comparison with GNN outputs\n- Combined approaches (heuristic initialization + neural refinement) show promise\n\n## Recommendations for Future Work\n\n1. **Hybrid Approaches**: Combine heuristic initialization with neural network refinement\n2. **Specialized Algorithms**: Develop graph-structure-aware heuristics for regular graphs\n3. **Parallel Processing**: Implement multi-threaded versions of SA and BLS\n4. **Dynamic Programming**: Explore exact algorithms for smaller subproblems\n\n## Usage in Training Pipeline\n\nThis notebook's algorithms can be integrated into the training pipeline as:\n- **Baseline comparisons** for neural network performance\n- **Label generation** for supervised learning approaches\n- **Warm start initialization** for neural network training\n- **Solution validation** for neural network outputs\n\nThe standardized interface makes it easy to plug these algorithms into existing training workflows.",
